<h2>Almost Maine, Almost Love</h2>
<h3>Devonte Fuller</h3>
<p>
It's burdening my soul, <br>
cutting a hole through my heart<br>
All I ask is that you give me what I want<br>
I can't take it anymore, my head pounds with every second<br>
Despite my view of seeming nonchalant
</p>
<p>
With each and every second I feel worse and worse and worse<br>
Why can't I have what you've neglected me?<br>
This torment, this is vain, all my suf'ring, all my pain<br>
None of which you're ever able to see
</p>
<p>
That's it? That's all I get? I thoought there'd be much more<br>
After all it did take eleven years<br>
You're lying, where's the rest? This is just a silly game<br>
I'm in no mood for games and childish lore
</p>
<p>What do you mean that's all there is, are you saying I'm no good<br>
That I didn't give you every piece of me?<br>
I've returned you all of yours; it barely fit within my doors<br>
Give back my love I gave to you so I have some for me.
</p>
<h2>6/25/2016</h2>
<h3>Emily Hayes</h3>
<p>I fell in love with a girl. She wore dark, heavy makeup and whenever she smoked or drank, she'd
 leave a lipstick stain on the cigarette or on the rim of her cup. Her lips were cherry red, or wine  
 colored, or the same pink flush as her cheeks and sometimes I imagined she got her lips to be so red 
 because she kissed the sunsets purple and stole the fires of the sun. But then I saw how shaky her 
 hands were when she applied lipstick on a dirty bathroom mirror, eyeliner streaks on her face, a purse 
 full of makeup remover and concealer to hide the imperfections. Chants of "They won't know unless you tell
 them. Put on a smile and pretend. It will be okay."</p>
 <p>I fell in love with a girl. She talks in her sleep about bright, shiny objects that are sharp as a 
 knife and sting like a cut. She breaks her teeth on jagged glass and she munches on so many pills because
 the doctors are tired of trying to figure her out, so they prescribe her medicine to cure the anxiety and
 the migraines and the depression. Around the third refill, the pharmacist warned her to not pop them like
 candy. They swapped some of them with placeboes and thought she wouldn't notice. That's when the paranoia
 started up and the nightmares and the long talks about her bright shiny objects. She tells me not to worry,
 she'll be okay.</p>
 <p>I fell in love with a girl. We fought tooth and nail against each her relapses. She was the push into
 further destruction and I was the pull back into reality. She screamed a million curses at me and damned
 me to every hell she knew while she spit bile at me on the bathroom floor while I held her over the toliet.
 She clawed at me, like an animal, swiping across my face and cutting open my cheek. I told her to spit into
 the bowl and watched as she spit up her lipstick and her pretty words and when she's done throwing up, I make
 her sit in the bath tub while I scrub at her skin. If I close my eyes, I see her flying off with the ghouls
 and the ghosts to wreck the heavens, doing her bidding as she pleases. She'll throw up twice again before
 lying awake because the pain and the guilt keep her up. My hands will shake against her body as I try to tame
 the beast inside of her head. My hands will shake as I whisper over and over, "We will be okay."</p>

<h2>Monet Refuses the Operation</h2>
<h3>Lisel Mueller</h3>
<p>
Doctor, you say there are no haloes<br>
around the streetlights in Paris<br>
and what I see is an aberration<br>
caused by old age, an affliction.<br>
I tell you it has taken me all my life<br>
to arrive at the vision of gas lamps as angels,<br>
to soften and blur and finally banish<br>
the edges you regret I don’t see,<br>
to learn that the line I called the horizon<br>
does not exist and sky and water,<br>
so long apart, are the same state of being.<br>
Fifty-four years before I could see<br>
Rouen cathedral is built<br>
of parallel shafts of sun,<br>
and now you want to restore<br>
my youthful errors: fixed<br>
notions of top and bottom,<br>
the illusion of three-dimensional space,<br>
wisteria separate<br>
from the bridge it covers.<br>
What can I say to convince you<br>
the Houses of Parliament dissolve<br>
night after night to become<br>
the fluid dream of the Thames?<br>
I will not return to a universe<br>
of objects that don’t know each other,<br>
as if islands were not the lost children<br>
of one great continent.  The world<br>
is flux, and light becomes what it touches,<br>
becomes water, lilies on water,<br>
above and below water,<br>
becomes lilac and mauve and yellow<br>
and white and cerulean lamps,<br>
small fists passing sunlight<br>
so quickly to one another<br>
that it would take long, streaming hair<br>
inside my brush to catch it.<br>
To paint the speed of light!<br>
Our weighted shapes, these verticals,<br>
burn to mix with air<br>
and change our bones, skin, clothes<br>
to gases.  Doctor,<br>
if only you could see<br>
how heaven pulls earth into its arms<br>
and how infinitely the heart expands<br>
to claim this world, blue vapor without end.
